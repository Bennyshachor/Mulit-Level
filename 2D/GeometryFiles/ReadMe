There exist two types of JLD2 files.
1) Allows to load the Multi-Level parameters.
which are: 
L idx Levelidx.
L: the discrete Laplacian wih Neumann boundary conditions where the nodes used are
the nodes of the design variables centers on the specific level. 
idx: An array with the size of the number of elements. Each entree represent an element, as in the element list (Elem).
The value in the entree is of the design variable the element is located in.
Levelidx: An array with the size of the number of level design variables. Each entree represent a design variable.
The value in the entree is of the number of design variable it is located from one level coarser.

The Design variables are numbered from top to bottom and from left to right.
